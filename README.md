# Rest Coutries

This challange is based on [these descriptions](https://alibaba-rest-countries.vercel.app/).

## Demo
Here is the static version of the app deployed on netlify: [https://rest-countries-nuxt.netlify.app/](https://rest-countries-nuxt.netlify.app/)

## Run Universal
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Run Local

Make sure to install the dependencies. I suggest you use pnpm for better performance:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install

# Run dev server
pnpm run dev
```
The development server is on `http://localhost:3000`
